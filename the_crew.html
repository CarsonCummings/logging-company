<p><center><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">The day to day operation of a logging company is not a task easily performed by
one person. It often takes a team and in the case of Kelvin Brown Logging, a family.
Many of the employees at Kelvin Brown Logging (KBL) have been with the company
for several years and have helped the company grow into what it is today. They have
become part of the Kelvin Brown Logging family. The day starts early and ends late for
Kelvin and the crew. The labor crew is comprised of 6 experienced loggers, while the
driving fleet is comprised of 3 licensed and qualified CDL drivers. The office staff keeps
different hours and is made up of 2 experienced accounting clerks/administrative
assistants. </p></center>
